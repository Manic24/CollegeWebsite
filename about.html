        <h1>Pondicherry Technological University:</h1>
        <p class="big">Pondicherry Engineering College (PEC) is an Institution sponsored by the Union Territory of Pondicherry, India. The College was started in 1984 under the VII Five Year Plan. It is an autonomous Institution for the purposes of administration, staff recruitment and College development and is managed by a Board of Governors. The College is affiliated to Pondicherry University, Pondicherry, for the academic purposes. The College has been growing from strength to strength since its inception.

The College campus is situated at Pillaichavady which is about 12 km from the Railway station and bus-stand in Pondicherry town. <br>It is about 160 km south of Chennai (Madras) on the shores of Bay of Bengal. The campus is also well connected by town buses from Pondicherry. Buses ply between Chennai (Madras) and Pondicherry frequently and the duration of journey is about 3 to 4 hours. The buses that come from Chennai via East Coast Road (ECR) stop near the campus itself. Commutation by auto-rickshaws from Pondicherry city would cost around Rs. 75.

The temperatures during the year vary between 25oC to 35oC, but it is always less harsher than other coastal cities making the place very pleasant and congenial for professional education.<br> The campus is of great scenic beauty and forms an excellent setting for the pursuit of studies in engineering and technology.

The well planned departmental buildings, library, hostels, students' amenities centre, open air theatre, residential quarters for staff with neatly laid out roads, lawns and gardens constitute the PEC campus which is about 210 acres.</p>
